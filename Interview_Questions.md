Q: Can you explain the CICD process in your current project ? or Can you talk about any CICD process that you have implemented ?

A: In the current project we use the following tools orchestrated with Jenkins to achieve CICD.
   - Maven, Sonar, AppScan, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes
   
   Coming to the implementation, the entire process takes place in 8 steps
    
    1. Code Commit: Developers commit code changes to a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
    2. Jenkins Build: Jenkins is triggered to build the code using Maven. Maven builds the code and runs unit tests.
    3. Code Analysis: Sonar is used to perform static code analysis to identify any code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and bugs.
    4. Security Scan: AppScan is used to perform a security scan on the application to identify any security vulnerabilities.
    5. Deploy to Dev Environment: If the build and scans pass, Jenkins deploys the code to a development environment managed by Kubernetes.
    6. Continuous Deployment: ArgoCD is used to manage continuous deployment. ArgoCD watches the Git repository and automatically deploys new changes to the development environment as soon as they are committed.
    7. Promote to Production: When the code is ready for production, it is manually promoted using ArgoCD to the production environment.
    8. Monitoring: The application is monitored for performance and availability using Kubernetes tools and other monitoring tools.
   

Q: What are the different ways to trigger jenkins pipelines ?

A: This can be done in multiple ways,
   To briefly explain about the different options,
   ```
     - Poll SCM: Jenkins can periodically check the repository for changes and automatically build if changes are detected. 
                 This can be configured in the "Build Triggers" section of a job.
                 
     - Build Triggers: Jenkins can be configured to use the Git plugin, which allows you to specify a Git repository and branch to build. 
                 The plugin can be configured to automatically build when changes are pushed to the repository.
                 
     - Webhooks: A webhook can be created in GitHub to notify Jenkins when changes are pushed to the repository. 
                 Jenkins can then automatically build the updated code. This can be set up in the "Build Triggers" section of a job and in the GitHub repository settings.
   ```



Q: What is latest version of Jenkins or which version of Jenkins are you using ?

A: This is a very simple question interviewers ask to understand if you are actually using Jenkins day-to-day, so always be prepared for this.


Q: can you use Jenkins to build applications with multiple programming languages using different agents in different stages ?

A: Yes, Jenkins can be used to build applications with multiple programming languages by using different build agents in different stages of the build process.

Jenkins supports multiple build agents, which can be used to run build jobs on different platforms and with different configurations. By using different agents in different stages of the build process, you can build applications with multiple programming languages and ensure that the appropriate tools and libraries are available for each language.

For example, you can use one agent for compiling Java code and another agent for building a Node.js application. The agents can be configured to use different operating systems, different versions of programming languages, and different libraries and tools.

Jenkins also provides a wide range of plugins that can be used to support multiple programming languages and build tools, making it easy to integrate different parts of the build process and manage the dependencies required for each stage.

Overall, Jenkins is a flexible and powerful tool that can be used to build applications with multiple programming languages and support different stages of the build process.


Q: How to add a new worker node in Jenkins ?

A: Log into the Jenkins master and navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes > New Node. Enter a name for the new node and select Permanent Agent. Configure SSH and click on Launch.

Q: How to add a new plugin in Jenkins ?

A: Using the UI,

   1. Click on the "Manage Jenkins" link in the left-side menu.
   2. Click on the "Manage Plugins" link.

Q: What is JNLP and why is it used in Jenkins ?

A: In Jenkins, JNLP is used to allow agents (also known as "slave nodes") to be launched and managed remotely by the Jenkins master instance. This allows Jenkins to distribute build tasks to multiple agents, providing scalability and improving performance.

   When a Jenkins agent is launched using JNLP, it connects to the Jenkins master and receives build tasks, which it then executes. The results of the build are then sent back to the master and displayed in the Jenkins user interface.

Q: What are some of the common plugins that you use in Jenkins ?

A: Maven Integration Plugin, Git Plugin, Docker Pipeline Plugin, SonarQube Scanner Plugin
